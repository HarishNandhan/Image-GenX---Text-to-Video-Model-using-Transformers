<s> explain about law of attraction in 50 words



Law of Attraction is the idea that by focusing your thoughts on positive or negative aspects, you can attract these same results into your life. It's based on the theory that all thoughts are energy and that you attract into your life whatever you think about most.

It's often associated with The Secret, a 2006 book by Rhonda Byrne, but the Law of Attraction has been studied by philosophers for centuries.

It's often seen as a form of positive thinking, but critics argue that it can be overly simplistic and ignores the role of personal responsibility in one's life.</s>
